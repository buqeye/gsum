The BUQEYE Model package provides two classes that allow one to analyze the convergence pattern of Effective Field Theory (EFT) observables.
Specifically, this is a MCMC-based implementation of the statistical model developed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01343).
The heavy lifting is done by the `PyMC3` package, which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3).

# Installation

The latest release of BUQEYE Model can be installed from PyPI using `pip`:
```
pip install buqeyemodel
```

# Dependencies

BUQEYE Model has only been tested with python 3.5, and currently relies only on `PyMC3>=3.1rc3`.
